This file contains the hardware design files for the LeafLabs Maple.

The design files for Maple Rev 1 live in maple-r1.  Similarly, Revs 3
and 5 respectively live in maple-r3 and maple-r5.

Rev 5 has not seen any electrical changes since its first release, but
we've changed it silkscreen in order to fix a couple of mistakes since
its first release.
