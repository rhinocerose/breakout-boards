# Changes to this project

Footprints for

* 0406 / 0603 / 0806 / 1204 packages - a carrier for 7  of these on a DIP-14 footprint. Practical use, some circuits I built benefit from having more space to stuff these discrete things.
* A 12AX7 breakout board
* An EF86 breakout board.
* Created 3D CAD model for VT9-PT tube socket.

## 2020-10-14

* Publish project to github,
* Create readme, license file.
* Do a write up with pictures for how to use the boards. Use the soic-8 as an example.

Footprints for

* SOT-23-5 - for these single gate logic devices.

Kick off the project.

Design footprints for

* soic-8 - include optional capacitor footprints for if using an op amp, or standard ic.
* soic-14 - include optional capacitor footprints for logic ic or atmel microcontrollers.
* soic-16 - include optional capacitor footprints for logic ic.
* dpak (TO-252)
* d2pak (TO-263)
* sot-23-3
* SMD-6 - i.e. optocouplers.
* 0406 / 0603 / 0806 / 1204 packages - a carrier for 4 of these on a DIP-8 footprint.
