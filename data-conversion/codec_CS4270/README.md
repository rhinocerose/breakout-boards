###                    [CS4270 Product Data Sheet](https://statics.cirrus.com/pubs/proDatasheet/CS4270_DS686F2.pdf)


The CS4270 is a stereo audio codec  with single-ended inputs and outputs, and a dynamic range of 105 dB and  THD+N of -95 dB. Requiring a minimal set of passive external components, the CS4270 provides designers with a simple solution that reduces the  bill-of-materials cost and the required space on their printed circuit  board. Configuring the IC through an industry standard control port  provides access to additional features such as logarithmic digital  volume control. The CS4270 utilizes Popguard® technology for controlling clicks and pops associated with power cycling, which eliminates external mute control circuitry.
